            Welcome to <strong className="text-primary">{TOKEN_NAME}</strong>, a
            revolutionary token built on the Solana blockchain.
            <br />
            <br /> Our mission is simple yet impactful. To become the primary
            cryptocurrency to support <strong>Lemurs</strong> like Mort and King
            Julian of Madagascar.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are going to achieve this by reserving <strong>10%</strong> of
            the tokens in a wallet for saving the wild animals.
            <br />
            <br /> ðŸ’° Fill your bags
            <br /> ðŸ”¥ 100x in the next days
            <br /> ðŸš€ Be one of the {TOKEN_NAME} early investors
